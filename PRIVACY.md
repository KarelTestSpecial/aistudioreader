      by the JavaScript code running in your browser.
   2. No Uploads: The contents of your file are never uploaded to any external server, database, or third-party service. The
      entire conversion process happens and stays on your machine.

      the extension in any way.

  Permissions

  This extension requires no special permissions to operate, further ensuring your privacy and security.

  Changes to This Policy

  functionality were to change in a way that impacts data handling, this policy would be updated accordingly, and users
  would be notified.
